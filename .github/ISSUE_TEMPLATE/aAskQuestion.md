STOP RIGHT HERE - DO NOT CREATE A TICKET FOR A QUESTION ON THIS REPOSITORY

1. Start with https://boxstarter.org/WhyBoxstarter to see if your question or issue already has an answer.
1. Check that there has not already been an issue raised for this by searching keywords on the issues page.

The best routes for getting questions answered when the documentation doesn't serve what you need is the mailing list or in chat:
- email - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/boxstarter
- chat - https://gitter.im/chocolatey/boxstarter

NOTE: Keep in mind we have an etiquette regarding communication that we expect folks to observe when they are looking for support in the Chocolatey community. https://github.com/chocolatey/boxstarter/blob/master/README.md#etiquette-regarding-communication
